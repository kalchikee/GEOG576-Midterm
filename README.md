## How This App Works

You click on the link and view the map. After doing so, a user can:

1. **Get Started**: Review the welcome guide explaining all features
2. **Explore Stories**: Use the "Recent Stories" sidebar to see what others have shared
3. **Add Your Experience**: Click the "Add Record" button to document your own nature experience
4. **Navigate the Map**: Use search, location services, and basemap options
5. **Read Details**: Click on any point to see the full story with photos and details

Users are prompted through a questionnaire where they can describe what they saw, post pictures, mark the date they experienced it, and answer questions about their experience. Once submitted, the point will show up on the map where other users can see and be inspired by the story.
