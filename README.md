Disclaimer: This is a sample for the My Nature Diary. Due to time constraints, I could only gather trail data for the US National Parks and Minnesota State Parks. Future endeavors would include adding more trail data from other states and countries.

This project allows users to manually document their experiences they had through nature. Whether it is a pretty place or an interesting creature, this code allows users to describe what they saw and write down their experiences like a journal or diary. Other users can see their posts, motivating people to explore the great outdoors and to find a sense of place, wherever it may be! 

This project should be an instant run web app, allowing all users to submit what they please. If there are any innapropriate posts, an admin can delete said point for not following the guidelines. 

How this app works: You click on the link and view the map. After doing so, a user can click the "Add Record" button to add an experience of their choosing. They are then prompted through a questionnaire, where they are prompted to answer questions regarding their experience. They can describe what they saw, post pictures of what they saw, mark the date they experienced it and answer brief questions regarding what they experienced. Once submitted, the point will show up on the map where other users can see what the initial user saw. 

Other contributors can work more on the front end features. Contriburtors can add an interactive comments field in which other users can comment under different points other users have posted. Aside some aestethic front end adjustments, the majority of the working operations can be fixed through ArcGIS Online.
